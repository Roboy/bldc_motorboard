@W: MT529 :"/home/letrend/workspace/bldc_motorboard/software/icecube2_template/quad.v":16:2:16:7|Found inferred clock top|CLK which controls 177 sequential elements including quad_counter0.count[31:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
